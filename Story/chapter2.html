                The coffee machine suddenly began working. Making even louder sounds this time. Finally,
                the cup has been filled. Feeling of success has filled my entire body while looking towards the cup
                and smelling the coffee. It seemed euphoric really. Hands felt like trembling while reaching for the
                awaited coffee. As my palms were getting closer, I realized, something didn't feel right. I didn't feel
                high temperature that was usually perceived while reaching for it. As soon as I tried to grasp the cup.
                I couldn't. I couldn't get the grasp of it. It felt like I'm trying to get a hold of a hologram,
                that was never truly real.
