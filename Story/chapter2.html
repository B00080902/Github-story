                The coffee machine suddenly began working. Making even louder sounds this time. Finally,
                the cup has been filled. Feeling of success has filled my entire body while looking towards the cup
                and smelling the coffee. It seemed euphoric really. Hands felt like trembling while reaching for the
                awaited coffee. As my palms were getting closer, I realized, something didn't feel right. I didn't feel
                high temperature that was usually perceived while reaching for it. As soon as I tried to grasp the cup.
                I couldn't. I couldn't get the grasp of it. It felt like I'm trying to get a hold of a hologram,
                that was never truly real.

                I quickly pulled my hands back. <i>"Maybe I got a <strong>caffeine</strong> rush?"</i> - I thought.
                <i>"But I shouldn't be hallucinating if that'd be the case"</i> - I mumbled to myself. The cup looked
                like it's diminishing bit by bit. Together with the coffee inside it. I stepped away from the coffee
                machine - thinking <i>"Maybe, just maybe I finally drank <strong>too</strong> much coffee?"</i>. Then
                again, it's never enough coffee. It's like water, it will let you stay alive and make you keep writing
                the given assignments and projects. With a small cost of course - increase of the blood pressure.
                Which could result in various cases. But is it worth the risk you ask me? Yes. Yes, it is. The taste
                and warmth within, gives you the ability to accomplish your goals.
                The cup has finally diminished - without a trace.
