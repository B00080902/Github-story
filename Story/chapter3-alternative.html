                Still placid around. Hundred different thoughts were going through my head. "<i>This can't be real</i>" - I kept thinking. "<i>Am I dreaming?</i>" - I asked myself. The surreal image was still in my head. The machine produced several bursts of harsh and unwelcoming sound. The coffee cup has re - appeared. Full. As I gazed upon the cup, with eyes full of fear and unable to understand the situation, I tried to take the cup. This time I managed to grasp the cup. A strange figure was appearing inside the drink. "<i>Why is my coffee showing numbers instead of milk froth</i>" - I thought. After several moments a number finally became clear.

                "<i>403...</i>" - I whispered in fear, recognising that code. The coffee cup stood still. As I looked up to see the LCD screen on the machine, I saw a message. A message that raises fear and horror for each specialist in my field of specialization. I reached for the cup. I grasped the cup in my hand. Which gave a feeling of surprise. "<i>I am still able to grasp the cup?</i>" - I wondered.

                As I tried moving the cup, is stayed still as rock. Putting strength to work, seemed effortless as I would've been denied the access anyways. The last number denoted inside coffee cup began changing into a number four. The coffee slowly began disappearing. As it has been nearly faded, the LCD screen message changed. It read <strong>408 Request Timeout</strong>.
