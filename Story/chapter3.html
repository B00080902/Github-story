            Still placid around. Hundred different thoughts were going through my head. "<i>This can't be real</i>" - I kept thinking. "<i>Am I dreaming?</i>" - I asked myself. The surreal image was still in my head. The machine produced several bursts of harsh and unwelcoming sound. The coffee cup has re - appeared. Full. As I gazed upon the cup, with eyes full of fear and unable to understand the situation, I tried to take the cup. This time I managed to grasp the cup. A strange figure was appearing inside the drink. "<i>Why is my coffee showing numbers instead of milk froth</i>" - I thought. After several moments a number finally became clear.

                "<i>503...</i>" - I whispered in confusion. As the numbers were getting clearer another four letters appeared. As they were forming, a word became visible. My heart raced as I read the word. The fear was growing within me in seconds. I became petrified of what I've seen. In a slight tone of fear I mumbled "<i> Error 503 ...</i>" I knocked my head up. "<i>This can't be real</i>" - I kept saying in my head.

                When I looked up, to see the LCD screen lighting up on the coffee machine which read "<i>503 Service Unavailable</i>". A light blue light began shining brightly to the right of the screen. As soon as I looked t it, I calmed down. It was the company's logo, which had made the machine. The logo read "<i>Internet Explorer</i>" in big letters.
