                So it begins in early January. Driving up to the car park, in gloomy fresh cold air, parking in the same spot seemed quite dull. Thinking to myself, "<i>Here we go again</i>".
                In the distance several familiar figures appeared.I stepped out of the car, just feel the cold breeze go through my neck. I heard humans, shouting in the distance.
                As the figures approached me, I began to recognise them. It was my old friends, that went through everything from the very start with me. "It's about time you got here", Aaron says. "Had to grab a coffee on the way", I responded and picked up my bag from my car. Jakub started explaining his holidays.

                Going to canteen, noticing those familiar morning faces, standing at the coffee machines. As usual, one of them never functions, which usually creates bigger and longer queues. Finally, touched the button for "<i>Cappuchino</i>". The machine started grinding the coffee beans inside, producing an unconfortably loud sound. I noticed it's not the usual process. Only a few drops of coffee into the cup. "Is there enough beans?", I mumbled. A minute passed. I began to doubt, that I will be receiving my daily morning caffeine intake. I looked around for staff members. Everyone was busy. The coffee cup remained unfilled.
